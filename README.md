Visualizing Business Trends
=========

Python scripts to visualize how a business is performing by plotting trends for desired metrics, and overlaying annotated events on a timeline, to allow users to study the effect of those events on the performance.
Includes sample data which can be used as a template for the input files.
To use your own data, annotate notable events with date when it occurred, date till when its effect lasted, and severity of the effect on a scale of -3 to 3, where -3 is an event with a strong negative effect, and 3 is an event with a strong positive effect. They are presented colour-coded on the graph for easy and immediate visualization.

- Download the script and sample files
- Open your preferred command line interface
 - Navigate to the folder with the script and data files
 - Run script: `python milestones.py`
